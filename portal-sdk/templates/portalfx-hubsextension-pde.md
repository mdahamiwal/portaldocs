## BrowseResourceListPart

This part represents a browse V2 grid list for a specific resource type.  This is usually not used directly and is
used by the BrowseResourceBlade.  However, it can use referenced if the inputs are provided.  The inputs include
the 'bladeId' which is used to identify the owner blade and is used to communicate query errors from the browse data

the resources that should appear in the list.  The 'selectedSubscriptions' input is an array of selected subscriptions
that filters the list and is generally the output from the ResourceFilterPart.subscriptions property.  The
'subscriptionsFiltered' input is a flag to indicate the selectedSubscriptions input is currently filtered.  The
'filter' input is the text filter for the resources that should appear in the list and is generally the output from
the ResourceFilterPart.filter property.  The optional 'scope' input is the scope for the resources that should appear
in the list and can be a fully qualified subscription ID (/subscriptions/..subID..) to show only the resources from
the given subscription, a resource group ID (/subscriptions/..subID../resourcegroups/..resgroupID..) to show only the
resources contained in the given resource group or a resource ID
(/subscriptions/..subID../resourcegroups/..resgroupID../providers/..provider../..type../..resID..) to show only the
nested resources under the given resource.

## BrowseResourceListPartWithCookie

This part represents a BrowseResourceListPart with an additional cookie input.  Currently this is not used and is a
placeholder when custom data sources are added to browse V2.
